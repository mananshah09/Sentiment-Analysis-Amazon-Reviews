# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a sentiment analysis project on Amazon reviews. The goal of this project is to train machine learning models to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of reviews for  products sold on Amazon.

## Assignment Details
This project involves hands-on experience with text representations and the use of text classification for sentiment analysis. It includes data preparation, data cleaning, preprocessing, feature extraction, and training machine learning models using different algorithms such as Perceptron, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Multinomial Naive Bayes.

## Dataset
The dataset is available for download from the following link:
[Amazon Reviews Dataset](https://web.archive.org/web/20201127142707if_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Office_Products_v1_00.tsv.gz)

## Machine Learning Models
This project utilizes the following machine learning models for sentiment analysis:
- **Perceptron**: A linear classifier used for binary classification tasks.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful algorithm for classification tasks that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.
- **Logistic Regression**: A regression model used for binary classification by estimating probabilities using a logistic function.
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features.

## Results
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for different machine learning models are reported in the pynb file.
- Sample reviews before and after data cleaning and preprocessing are provided in the notebook.
